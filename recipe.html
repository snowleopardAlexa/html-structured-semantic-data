    <h2>Versatile Cake Frosting</h2>

    <p>This is my go-to frosting when I’m baking cupcakes with my son. You can substitute different extract flavors and add food coloring to jazz it up, if you like. This recipe will frost about two-dozen cupcakes or one 8-inch, two-layer round cake.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract </li>
        <li>5 tablespoons buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all ingredients together in a medium-size glass bowl until well incorporated. </li>
        <li>Refrigerate for 20 minutes before frosting your cupcakes or cake.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: Many factors, including humidity and temperature, can affect the consistency of frosting, and adjustments may be needed to make up for them. If the consistency is too soft, add more powdered sugar, 1-2 tablespoons at a time. If it’s too thick, add 1-2 teaspoons of buttermilk until the consistency is perfect for your application. </p>
